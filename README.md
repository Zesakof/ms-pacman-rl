Learning to play Ms. Pac-Man with reinforcement learning.

Playing Ms. Pac-Man involves handling risk and reward trade-offs in simultaneously pursuing additional points while evading ghosts. To be successful, players must develop a strategy that incorporates both the ghostsâ€™ positions in 2D space as well as the proximity of rewards. I begin by training baseline reinforcement learning agents that follow random, proximal policy optimization (PPO), and Deep Q-Network (DQN) policies. Then I implement modifications to experiment with the impacts of gray-scaling, action trimming, reward hacking, and random starts in this arcade setting. Taken together, these modifications provide insights into strategies that succeed and fail when teaching an agent to play Ms. Pac-Man.
